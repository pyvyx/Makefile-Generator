add compiler options gcc/g++ && clang/clang++:
	when selected use gcc/clang for c files and g++ and clang++ for c++ files

add headerfiles as depencies, in order to rebuild the project when they've been modified
add a c++/c version selector (c++17/c++20...)
use seperate flags for c++ and c
add ability to select folder and then get all c/c++ files in this folder
to fix: include dirs (and probably other as well) dont't have a path when select on different harddrive (suggestion: check if it on the C/D/E drive and respond accordingly)
add support for assembly

This makefile specific:
	add -Wl,--subsystem,windows or -mwindows to remove the console (windows only)


--done: the target to build the exe has the libaries and lib dirs flags 2 times
--done: add .PHONY
--done: add support for passing .res files
--fixed: makefile always links the binaries together since the EXE file doesnt have the proper extension
